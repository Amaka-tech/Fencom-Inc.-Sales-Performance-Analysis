## Problem Statement ‚ùì

Despite active operations and broad product offerings, Fencom Inc. lacked detailed, data-backed insights into its sales dynamics. 
This project was initiated to:
- Identify key revenue drivers.
- Detect underperforming categories.
- Examine seasonal trends and regional differences.
- Explore the influence of price, freight, and payment methods on sales.
Without these insights, critical decisions around marketing, inventory, and operations risk being misinformed.
