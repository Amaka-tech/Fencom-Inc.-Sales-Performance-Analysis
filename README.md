## About the Business 🏢

Fencom Inc. is a growing e-commerce company in the UK that offers a wide range of high-quality products across categories like Computers & Gaming, Fashion, Health & Beauty, and Home Appliances. This project leverages data analytics to explore and understand Fencom’s sales performance using Microsoft Excel. Fencom’s goal is to create a smooth and satisfying shopping experience by using data to guide strategic decisions.

## Problem Statement ❓

Despite active operations and broad product offerings, Fencom Inc. lacked detailed, data-backed insights into its sales dynamics. 
This project was initiated to:
- Identify key revenue drivers.
- Detect underperforming categories.
- Examine seasonal trends and regional differences.
- Explore the influence of price, freight, and payment methods on sales.
Without these insights, critical decisions around marketing, inventory, and operations risk being misinformed.

## Project Objectives 🎯

This analysis aims to answer the following key questions:
- What are the overall sales trends?
- Which products and sellers perform best?
- What are the most used payment methods?
- Are there seasonal or time-based fluctuations in sales?
- Are there differences in sales by gender or region?
- What delivery stages have the most activity?
